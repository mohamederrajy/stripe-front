# Frontend changes needed for Your Overview section

Due to the size of the changes, I'll deploy this via a deployment script that updates the frontend with:

1. **State Management**:
   - overviewData state
   - selectedDateRange state ('today', '7days', '4weeks', '6months', '12months', 'all_time')
   - loadingOverview state

2. **Fetch Function**:
   - getOverviewData() - fetches from /get-overview endpoint

3. **UI Section** (Add after Customer Stats, before Configuration):
   - Date range selector buttons
   - Payment statistics cards (Succeeded, Uncaptured, Refunded, Blocked, Failed)
   - Balance & Next Payout cards
   - Simple bar graphs for Gross/Net Volume
   - Dispute rate indicator

4. **Graph Implementation**:
   - Using CSS-based bar charts (no external libraries needed)
   - Responsive design matching dashboard theme

This will be a comprehensive overview dashboard giving you full insight into your Stripe account performance!
